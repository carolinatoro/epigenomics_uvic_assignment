#Submission task: 
#4. EN‐TEx ATAC‐seq data: downstream analyses
#Move to folder ATAC-seq, and create folders to store bigBed data files and peaks analyses files. Make sure the files are organized in a consistent way as done for ChIP-seq.

#Retrieve from a newly generated metadata file ATAC-seq peaks (bigBed narrow, pseudoreplicated peaks, assembly GRCh38) for stomach and sigmoid_colon for the same donor used in the previous sections. Hint: have a look at what we did here. Make sure your md5sum values coincide with the ones provided by ENCODE.

# From the tutorial, section 2 how to find experiments and programatically download data from ENCODE. What I did was find the same donor ENCDO451RUA, view all experiments, Biosample term name: stomach AND sigmoid colon and assay title ATAC-Seq, then I hit download and copy the URL on the same line on that downloaded metadata file

# For each tissue, run an intersection analysis using BEDTools: report 1) the number of peaks that intersect promoter regions, 2) the number of peaks that fall outside gene coordinates (whole gene body, not just the promoter regions). Hint: have a look at what we did here and here.

# the goal now is to perform intersection analysis using BEDtools to determine where ATAC-seq peaks lie in relation to gene annotation
# the steps I should follow are:
# ensure I have all needed files: BED files of ATAC-seq peaks per tissue, BED file of promoter regions (e.g. gencode v xx protein coding/non-redundant TSS bed files), and a BED file of gene bodies (protein.coding.gene.body.bed)
# intersect ATAC-seq peaks with promoter regions
# intersect ATAC-seq peaks with gene bodies
# find peaks that fall outside gene coordinates 

# first I need the annotation primary assembly file

# prepare the BED file with gene coordinates of protein-coding genes
# this is to uncompress the dile
gunzip annotation/gencode.v24.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz
# now convert the gtf annotation file to a BED format
# retrieve gene body coordinates of protein coding genes, remove mitochrondrial genes, move from a 1-based to a 0-based coordinate system
